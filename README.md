# Banking and Election Analysis

<h3><b>Overview:</b></h3>
This project came after a week of learning Python basics. We were tasked with importing csv's and running a variety of simple calculations. At this point, we had yet to dive into libraries and packages, so everything was done with Python's native capabilities. I have included a jupyter notebook where I revisited this project and completed it using pandas, just for the sake of comparison.

The Resources folder contains the corresponding datasets for PyPoll.py (election) and PyBank.py (banking, clearly).
